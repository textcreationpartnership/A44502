            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               </gap>re; as thoſe that are going from it, or far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and farther off it. So much is implyed in the phraſe of <hi>turning them to righteouſneſs.</hi> Which word, <hi>turning,</hi> though not formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Original Text here, yet is found in <hi>Luke</hi> 1.17. <hi>Acts</hi> 26.18. and in other places; and ſo the Scripture expreſly affirms of all men in their natural unconverted ſtate; yea of thoſe alſo that are under the Law, and are ſeeking and endeavouring after righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs according to the Law; <hi>that they are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable, there is none that doth good; no not one.

            <p n="2">2.

            <p n="1">1. There is a righteouſneſs wrought and prepared of God for us in both reſpects in Chriſt Jeſus; called therefore the <hi>righteouſneſs of God,</hi> and <hi>not our own.</hi> Phil. 3.8, 9. <hi>a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs without the Law;</hi> not commanded

               </gap>) <hi>for the ſins of the whole world:</hi> ſo as there is in him <hi>a plentious Redemption,</hi> a power and ſufficiency for the forgiveneſs of the ſins of the whole world: a covering plaiſter and hiding of ſins for all the world: and this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended on Gods part, as a Medicine or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation for the whole world; ſo as that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of ſins is with him therein for them all, as in a publick Fountaine or Treaſury
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:33142:58"/>where they may have it in a due repairing thither for it. Yea, and during the day of his grace and patience, their ſins are ſo far covered, as that they are preſerved there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by from actually periſhing, his patience is afforded that they might repent, to the end that in coming to him they might receive forgiveneſs of ſins; yea and title to Gods Promiſes and the bleſſings thereof; and be made righteous and conformable to him in themſelves (ſuch is the virtue in him) and ſo fitted and made meet for their enjoyment.

There is a righteous frame and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of Soul, and a righteous demean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, converſation and walking propoſed to us in the Scriptures of truth, in the word and doctrine of the Goſpel, to be followed after by us in the receiving of and walking in Chriſt Jeſus; which <hi>the grace of God that brings Salvation</hi> (or is ſaving) <hi>to all men teacheth,</hi> Tit. 2.11, 12. 1 Tim. 6.11. and

               <hi>All Scripture given by inſpiration of God is profitable to inſtruct and direct us in,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote in us, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15, 16.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That men may be turned to this righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs from their unrighteous ſtate and practices: or they may be made partakers and practicers thereof. It is true, no man can of himſelf turn himſelf thereto; or make himſelf righteous therewith. This alſo is of God; who as <hi>he made his Son who knew no ſin, ſin for us that we might be made the righteouſneſs of God in him:</hi> ſo alſo <hi>ſent his Son to bleſs us in turning every one of us from our iniquities.</hi> Acts 3.26. and hath <hi>put his ſpirit upon him that he might bring forth judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to us.</hi> By whom he hath alſo given forth his <hi>Law</hi> and Doctrine which is <hi>a mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the ſpirit,</hi> (and ſo is <hi>perfect converting the ſoul, Pſal.</hi> 19.7.) and of <hi>righteouſneſs.</hi> 2 Cor. 3.8, 9. The <hi>Goſpel,</hi> or preaching, <hi>of Chriſt is the power of God to ſalvation to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one that believeth:</hi> yea and <hi>the word of faith</hi> by which ſeriouſly heard and minded the heart is perſwaded to believe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.16. &amp; 10.8.17. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.3. With this our Lord Jeſus ſent his Servants to <hi>open the eyes of the blind, and to turn them from darkneſs to light, and from the power of Satan to God,</hi> Acts 26.18. True it is that all have not this Law and Doctrine of God alike clearly, nor ſome
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:33142:60"/>at all declared to them, but even there the goodneſs or kindneſs of God as otherwiſe evidenced, is leading them to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; to which alſo his chaſtiſments pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes them. And though they cannot by thoſe leſs clear means attain to that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and abundance of conſolation as men may by the clearer means the Law and Doctrine of God as audibly and diſtinctly made known (at leaſt ordinarily and without miracle) yet they that by ſuch means <hi>fear God and work righteouſneſs,</hi> or <hi>keep the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of the Law, their uncircumciſion is count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed circumciſion, and God</hi> through and by means of Chriſt <hi>accepts</hi> them, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.34. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4, 5, 26, 27. But the choice way and means that God uſeth for converſion and turning of men to himſelf, is the preaching of the Goſpel. That being a <hi>preaching of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and remiſſion of ſins in the name of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt,</hi> Luke 24.46, 47. and therein <hi>Chriſt is ſet forth a Prince and a Saviour, giving repentance and forgiveneſs of ſins,</hi> Acts 5.31. though ſo as yet men are therefore requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to liſten to him, and in hearing to receive the grace he gives for turning them, ſo as to <hi>repent and be converted that God may blot out their ſins and forgive them,</hi> Acts 3.19. Yea he now by and with the Goſpel preached to all Nations, <hi>commands
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:33142:60"/>all men every where to repent,</hi> Acts 17.30. whereunto his <hi>Spirit is not ſtraitned,</hi> or ſhortned, but ſo adminiſtred that <hi>his words do good to him that walks uprightly,</hi> that doth not willingly and ſtubbornly decline the force of them; winking with the eye, that he might not ſee, and hardning the heart, that he might not underſtand, and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted; but ſingly yields up to the power working therewith, <hi>Mic.</hi> 2.7. <hi>Matt.</hi> 13.12-15. <hi>Acts</hi> 28.26, 27.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That he makes uſe of Men and their Miniſtry or Service, even ſuch as he hath indued with wiſedome and capacity thereto, by holding forth that word, law, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and walking therein blameleſly, to be means or inſtruments for converting men and bringing them to righteouſneſs; by bringing them to Chriſt Jeſus to know, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on, and obey him. And ſuch as are made wiſe and gracious themſelves by that bleſſed word He commiſſionates and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands them to call others to Chriſt, that they might be made wiſe and righteous alſo in and by him. So <hi>He gave the word, and great was the company of publiſhers of it,</hi> Pſal. 68.11. and Chriſt being <hi>aſcended on high, gave gifts to men. And He gave ſome Apoſtles, ſome Prophets, ſome Evangeliſts,</hi> or Goſpel-preachers, <hi>ſome Paſtors and Teachers,</hi> furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:33142:61"/>them with gifts, and appointing them in the exerciſe of thoſe gifts to inſtruct o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that are ignorant in the knowledg of Chriſt, and thereby endeavour their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion unto God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.8-11. and ſo to make them Diſciples to Chriſt, and ſo wiſe and righteous perſons, <hi>Matt.</hi> 28.18, 19, 20. <hi>Mark</hi> 16.15, 16. He hath ſet them as the ſalt of the earth, and light of the world, to be uſeful and profitable to others, to draw them in alſo to glorifie God, Mat. 5.13, 14, 15, 16. Yea, <hi>The manifeſtation of the Spirit is given to every one to profit withal,</hi> 1 Cor. 12.7. and <hi>No man lights any candle to put it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a buſhel, or under a bed, but to ſet it on a Candleſtick, that it may give light to all that come into the houſe,</hi> Matt. 5.15. <hi>Every one that hears</hi> (that in any meaſure udderſtands and is obedient to the truth of the Goſpel) hath commiſſion and command from Chriſt to call others to him, endeavouring their coming to him, that they may be made righteous. <hi>Let him that heareth ſay, Come.</hi> Rev. 22.17. Chriſt commiſſionates neither all, nor only Univerſity Scholars, and thoſe that are learned in the Arts and Sciences to be his Miniſters, Preachers of his Goſpel, and inviters of men to Him; and ſo inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of turning them to righteouſneſs, and makers of them righteous. If they hear not
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:33142:61"/>his Call themſelves, and be not ſubject and obedient to Him, He commiſſionates them not to be his Preachers, nor accepts their ſervice, how learned ſoever otherwiſe they be. For <hi>to the wicked God ſaith, What haſt thou to do to declare my Statutes, or that thou ſhouldſt take my Covenant in thy mouth, ſeeing thou hateſt inſtruction, and caſteſt my words behind thee?</hi> Pſal. 50.16, 17. But whoſo hears, yea whither man or woman, learned or unlearned in worldly Sciences, they are bid to ſay, <hi>Come:</hi> and they may do it, ſo they keep (as all muſt) within their bounds, and go not beyond the proportion of Faith that they have received, or behave not themſelves diſorderly.

<pb n="68" facs="tcp:33142:62"/>and we read in the Church Hiſtory of a woman that was very inſtrumental in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting a Nation. <hi>Every man as he hath received the gift of God may miniſter the ſame one to another as good ſtewards of the manifold grace of God,</hi> 1 Pet. 4.10.

If men refuſe to come to Chriſt to be converted and gathered to him, and to God in, and by him, whom his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants would gather to him; their labour in that caſe ſhall not be in vain, they ſhall be accepted of God, and reckoned as ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers of many, or turners of them to God, becauſe they did faithfully endeavour it: even as <hi>Abraham</hi> in the Scripture is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to have offered up his Son <hi>Iſaac,</hi> though he was not actually ſacrificed, or ſlain, (God by his Angel interpoſing) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was really willing and ready to have offered him up, and intended it, <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſ.</hi> 22. with <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.17, 18. And our Lord Jeſus when he complained that He <hi>had laboured in vain and ſpent his ſtrength in vain, and for naught,</hi> becauſe when <hi>he would have gathered Iſrael, Iſrael would not be, or were
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:33142:63"/>not gathered,</hi> comforts himſelf in this, that <hi>his judgment was with the Lord, and his work</hi> or reward <hi>with his God.</hi> Iſa. 49.4. That is, God would judge him and reward him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his faithfulneſs, and heartie en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour after others good, as fully as if they had received the good he deſired. Thence he adds, that <hi>though Iſrael be not gathered, yet</hi> ſhould he be <hi>glorious in the eyes of the Lord, and his God would be his ſtrength.</hi> Yea, and make him ſucceſsful to others; not only <hi>to raiſe up the Tribes of Jacob, and to reſtore the preſerved</hi> (or deſolations) <hi>of Iſrael,</hi> but alſo <hi>to be, a light to the Gentiles, and to be his Salvation to the ends of the earth.</hi> verſe 5, 6.</p>
            <p>And truly that we may alſo note, that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten times when the labor of his ſervants prove unſucceſsful with ſome, he directs them to others with whom they find ſucceſs: as in the Parables of the marriage Dinner, and of the great Supper; when the labor of the ſervants in calling the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden Gueſts proved unſucceſsful, they ſetting light by the Feaſt and making excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes why they would not, or could not come; they were ordered to others, to call and bring them in, with whom their endeavours took ſuch place, that the Feaſt &amp; houſe was filled with Gueſts, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.1, 2-9, 10. <hi>Luke</hi> 14.16, 17-23. And when the Apoſtle
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:33142:63"/>
               <hi>Paul,</hi> labouring with the <hi>Jews</hi> to convince and turn them in to God, found them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing and obſtinate: God ſent him to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> that would hear, and many of them were converted by him. <hi>Acts</hi> 13.46, 47, 48, and 28.25-28. Yea many, in many places were brought in by his, and his fellow lobourors Miniſtry, as appears in many chapters of the book of the <hi>Acts.</hi> God often going forth with his Servants ſo as to prevaile upon peoples hearts. So he went forth with <hi>Peter</hi> and the Apoſtles at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſo as many thouſands were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted by them. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.41, 47. &amp; 4.4. &amp; 5.14. &amp; 21.20. Yea, and with thoſe that were not Apoſtles: and, for ought we find mentioned of them, no ordained per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, by any humane ordination. <hi>Thoſe that were ſcattered abroad by reaſon of the perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that aroſe about Stephen, went and Preached the word every where, and the hand of the Lord was with them, ſo as a great number believed and turned to the Lord.</hi> Acts 8.1, 4. &amp; 11.19, 20, 21. So doth God own and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany the faithful diligent endeavours of his Servants. He that received five Talents, and traded diligently with them, and he that received but two did likewiſe, both of them were ſo bleſſed of God in their tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, as to double their ſtock: that ſo no
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:33142:64"/>man might be diſcouraged from diligence by the leſs meaſure of his received furniture or gifts. Yea, and doubtleſs had he that had but one Talent, traded with it, and been faithful and diligent to improve it, he ſhould have been ſo bleſſed therein, as to have brought in an acceptable increaſe; perhaps two or three more, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.16, 17.</p>
            <p n="6">6. That where men in their faithful and diligent improvement of their Talents, are made inſtruments of converting men (<hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters by whom they believe as God gives to any or every one,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.5.) there he attributes the event and the effect to them, though but inſtruments, as if they were the Authors and Producers thereof. So here, they that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct many, and are ſucceeded with their converſion, are ſaid to turn many to righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, or to make many righteous; though the power was of God and not of them, and the praiſe to be given to him; without whoſe power and bleſſing they had done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, much leſs effected any good by their doing. So the effect is ſometimes attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Inſtrumental cauſe, ſometimes to the Principal. As the Axe is ſaid to hew or cut down a Tree, though of it ſelf it can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form no action; but the man that uſeth it may more properly be ſaid to hew or cut down with or by it. Thus our Saviour of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:33142:64"/>aſcribed his cures to the faith of the perſons cured, becauſe therethrough they received the benefit which they that belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not could not receive; not coming to him for it, or being judged unworthy of it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.22. <hi>Mark</hi> 5.34. &amp; 10.52. <hi>Luke</hi> 7.50. &amp; 8.48. &amp; 17.19. &amp; 18.42. with <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.58. <hi>Mark</hi> 6.5, 6.

After the ſame race or manner doth he here ſpeak of making others wiſe (as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer word may be rendred) and of turning to righteouſneſs, juſtifying or making juſt many. But as theſe things are all here im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, ſo it is here plainly and ſully expreſſed and ſaid;</p>

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:33142:72" rendition="simple:additions"/>of the Lord, but good to abound therein, which would be bootleſs and in vain, if men being believers on Chriſt in the main, ſhould be equally rewarded for doing little good, as if they, or others that did more. Indeed when there is a heart to do more, and the reaſon of not doing more is merely want of matter or capacity for doing more, there the reward of them that do leſs, as to the matter done or adminiſtred by them, may be as much or more than of them that have done more as to the matter done, having ability to have done ſtill more or better than they did; as in the caſe of the poor woman caſting in her two <hi>mites,</hi> which was all that ſhe had, into the Treaſury, accepted by our Saviour as doing more than all they that out of their ſuperfluity had caſt into it, though much more in quantity than ſhe had, <hi>Mark</hi> 12.41, 42, 43, 44. as alſo in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable of the Labourers, where they that wrought but one hour, not being called in ſooner, and as it may ſeem more referring themſelves to the good pleaſure of their Lord for their wages and reward, and leſs capitulating with him than thoſe that came ſooner, had equal reward with them, <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> 20.1-9 15.

And ſo its a good encouragement to greater diligence and abundance in the ſervice of God and Chriſt, knowing it ſhall not be in vain in the Lord, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.58. and yet ſo as puts no diſcouragement upon any that have hearts ſet to do more, but have leſs talents or abililities.

To commend to us the ſtudy of Wiſedome, or a diligent endeavour after it, as that which will be of greateſt advantage to us; for ſeeing they that be wiſe ſhall ſhine as the brightneſs of the Firmament in and after the Reſurrection, well may we ſay with <hi>Solomon, How much better is it to get wiſdome than gold! and to get underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, rather to be choſen than Silver,</hi> Pro. 16.16. It is true that much Silver and Gold will make men glitter here; but it is in things without them; their gay cloaths, and gawdy garniſhings of them, their houſes, houſhold
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:33142:73"/>ſtuff, horſes, and ſuchlike matter; but alas the glory and ſhine they give them, is as much below that of the wiſe man here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed and predicted, as the glory or ſhine of the <hi>Glow worm</hi> is below that of the brightneſs of the Firmament. Gold and Silver, <hi>Riches profit not in the day of wrath,</hi> from which wiſdome will make us <hi>wiſe to Salvation,</hi> giving us that <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> which <hi>delivers from Death.</hi> Prov. 11.4. <hi>A good Name is rather to be choſen than great riches, and loving kindneſs rather than Silver and Gold,</hi> Prov. 22.1. But it is not Silver and Gold that will without wiſedome give us a good name, much leſs loving favour with the Lord: but wiſdome will give us them; for <hi>Riches and Honour are with her, yea du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable riches and righteouſneſs,</hi> and <hi>whoſo ſinds her, finds life, and ſhall obtain favour of the Lord,</hi> Prov. 8.18, 34, 35. <hi>Wiſdome</hi> is that that <hi>will make a mans face to ſhine, and change the boldneſs</hi> (or ſtrongth) <hi>of his countenance,</hi> Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſ. 8.1. truly it puts a luſtre upon faces, or appearances now. <hi>Stephen</hi> who was a man indued with the Holy Spirit, and therethrough with <hi>ſuch wiſdome,</hi> as all his learned Adverſaries <hi>were not able to reſiſt,</hi> even when he came to anſwer his adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries accuſations for his life, in the preſence of the Greateſt Council in <hi>Jeruſalem, All
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:33142:74"/>that ſat in Council looking ſtedfaſtly on him ſaw his face, as it had been the face of an Angel,</hi> Acts 6.8-10-15. with 7.1. Oh what will it do when he ſhall appear with Chriſt in glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry? Men may be rich, and have riches, and yet leave little fame or glory behind them when they are gone; no nor have any great matter of luſtre while in poſſeſſion of them. How pittifully did <hi>Croeſus</hi> or <hi>Craſſus</hi> look to a judicious eye, and ſo <hi>Nabal</hi> and <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;</hi> but much more in the eye of God and his holy ones, in compariſon of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> or <hi>Peter,</hi> or <hi>Stephen,</hi> yea or any the leaſt in Gods Kingdome? Yea men may be rich and infamous, do ſo unworthily as to foile all their heights and enjoyments in the world by their fooliſh and ſordid acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as that rich man <hi>Nabal</hi> did, <hi>Whoſe name was Nabal and folly was with him:</hi> truly many have gotten greater fame, and ſhone more among men both in their life time and after death by their wiſdome, though but poor and mean perſons, than thoſe that have been very wealthy being void of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; as not only many Prophets and Apoſtles, but even many Heathens, that are yet famous for their wiſdome and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, though but a worldly and periſhing wiſdome: as far below the heavenly wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, as a ruſh light is below the brightneſs
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:33142:74"/>of the Firmament; and therefore that that will give them no luſtre in the Reſurrection. Surely <hi>Solomons</hi> wiſdome made him ſhine more than all the riches and honour of his Kingdome, others have been as rich as he, but none ſo wiſe: nor did his Riches ſo much as his great Wiſdom draw the Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> to come ſo far to ſee him: and yet his folly in loving ſtrange women, how much did it take off the luſtre of his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome! How much more gloriouſly would he have ſhone, had he been ſo wiſe as to have ſhunned that folly: and he prefers even <hi>a poor and wiſe child before an old and fooliſh King that will no more be admoniſhed, for this out of priſon may come to reign,</hi> when he other, though <hi>born in his Kingdome,</hi> may become <hi>poor,</hi> Eccleſ. 4.13, 14. eſpecially being wiſe with the wiſdome of God, which is the wiſdome here commended, as endring them that are wiſe therewith ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

For entertaining them, and making them happy, and this in Chriſt Jeſus, as it is ſaid, <hi>This is the record that God hath given of his Son, that God hath given us</hi> (even us mankind the ſame us that he commands to believe, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.27.) <hi>eternal life, and this life is in his Son,</hi> 1 Joh. 5.21.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To that purpoſe made his Son fleſh, and delivered him up to Death for us, for our Sins, and raiſed him for our Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; as it is ſaid, <hi>This is the Goſpel that we preached to you,</hi> viz. <hi>how firſt of all</hi> (or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the firſt things) <hi>Chriſt died for our ſins according to the Scriptures, and that He was buried, and that He roſe again the third day according to the Scriptures,</hi> 2 Cor. 15.3, 4. This is the meaning of thoſe expreſſions in the Parable. <hi>My oxen and my fatlings are killed,</hi> my choice things are ſacrificed for you, and their fleſh thereby are become meat for you, my Son who anſwered to all the Sacrifices of the Law, being delivered up to death for you, is become fit matter of nouriſhment for your ſouls; wherein is ſignified the greatneſs and freeneſs of the love and charity of the heart of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, in <hi>not ſparing his own</hi> dearly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved

<pb n="133" facs="tcp:33142:94"/>they may not fail of the enjoyment thereof; <hi>Come to the Marriage, Come eat of my bread, and drink of the wine that I have mingled: forſake the fooliſh, and live, and go in the way of underſtanding,</hi> Prov. 9.5, 6. <hi>Be ye recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled unto God; yea, we beſeech you in Chriſts ſtead, as if God did beſeech you by us.

An evident ſignification that it is the bleſſed, gracious good will and loving mind of God, that men, any or every man, to whom the call comes, ſhould be partakers of this proviſion, <hi>The ſimple and ſuch as have no underſtanding</hi> He would have to come and eat; <hi>Every one that thirſteth, and he that hath no money,</hi> nothing good or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireable in himſelf, ſuch as are not graciouſly thirſting for Chriſt, but are <hi>laying out money for that that is not bread, and labouring for that that ſatisfies not:</hi> Yea, <hi>He would have the wicked forſake their ways, and the unrighteous their thoughts, and turn to him, and He will be gracious to them, and abundantly pardon them,</hi> Iſai. 55.1, 2, 7. <hi>The poor, the halt, the maimed, and thoſe in the high-waies and hedges,</hi> the worſt of men he would have them come to the Supper prepared by him, <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.21, 23. <hi>He would not that any ſhould periſh, but that all come to repentance,</hi> 2 Peter 3.9. <hi>Would have all men ſaved and come to
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:33142:95"/>the knowledg</hi> (or acknowledgment) <hi>of the truth,</hi> 1 Tim. 2.4. <hi>Hath no pleaſure at all in the death of the wicked; but rather that they ſhould turn to him in his Son and live,</hi> Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiel 33.11. and 18.23. 32. and to that end He <hi>calls</hi> and invites them <hi>from the riſing of the Sun, to the going down of the ſame,</hi> Pſal. 50.1, 2. <hi>All the ends of the earth,</hi> Iſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah 45.22. and waits with long patience upon them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4, 5. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.9-15. even to <hi>Jezabel</hi> he gave ſpace to repent of her evil deeds, <hi>Ren.</hi> 2.21. for Chriſt <hi>ſtands at the door,</hi> of mens hearts, <hi>and knocks, and if any man hear his voice, and open to him, He will come in and ſup with him,</hi> &amp;c.

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That there is a neceſſity of coming to and believing on Chriſt for the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this grace and glory prepared in him, becauſe</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is all treaſured up in Chriſt for us, ſo as not to be enjoyed or received but in and with Chriſt. <hi>How ſhall not he with Chriſt</hi> (not apart from or without Chriſt) <hi>freely give us all things,</hi> Rom. 8.32. <hi>This life is in his Son; He that hath the Son hath life, and he that hath not the Son, hath not life,</hi> 1 Joh. 5.11,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:33142:95"/>12. The Feaſt is prepared in Wiſdomes houſe, and ſhe and her ſervants go forth to call men to it in the houſe, but do not carry it out of the houſe to them to be eaten in the ſtreets, <hi>Prov.</hi> 9.1-5, 6. for men may not have forgiveneſs of Sins, the Holy Spirit, the grace and bleſſing of God in their own ſinful ways, becauſe Chriſt hath died for them; but for thoſe things they muſt <hi>forſake the fooliſh, and leave their own waies, and come in to him and his waies,</hi> For</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>God is not a God that hath pleaſure in wickedneſs, evil may not dwell with him, fools may not ſtand in his ſight; he hates</hi> (as to fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with them) <hi>all the workers of iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> Pſal. 5.4, 5. No unclean thing or unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous thing or perſon therefore, may enter into or inherit his his Kingdom, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9. <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.27. and therefore there is a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, that we be waſhed, ſanctified, juſtifii<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, made wiſe and righteous, which we cannot be but by turning to God in and by Jeſus Chriſt, believing on and obeying him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It was Gods end in ſending his Son, and Chriſts in giving himſelf for us, that <hi>He might redeem us from all iniquity, and purifie to himſelf a peculiar people, zealous of good works.</hi> Not that he might juſtifie and ſave us, and make us happy in our ſins and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleaneſs,

               <p n="4">4. Neglecting and refuſing to come to Chriſt, to believe on and follow him, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men muſt needs periſh in thir ſins and uncleaneſs. For</p>
               <p n="1">1. All things in this life and world will fail, being vain and momentany. <hi>All fleſh is graſs, and the goodlineſs thereof as the flower of graſs,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.24. <hi>The world paſſeth away, and the faſhion and luſt</hi> (or deſire) <hi>of it,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.17. 1 Cor. 7.31. and all our own <hi>wiſdom</hi> is <hi>bruitiſhneſs and folly, with an enmity to God,</hi> and he will <hi>deſtroy it,</hi> Jer. 10.14. 1 Cor. 1.19. &amp; 3.19, 20. and all our righteouſneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and goodneſs, though after the Law, but as a <hi>menſtruous ragge,</hi> ſo as we cannot live in, or be juſtified by and on account of it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64.6. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.20. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Chriſt will preſerve us from pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.11.12.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Yea mens neglects of and rejections of Gods Grace and great Salvation, provokes his heavy anger and diſpleaſure, which will kindle a fire that will never be quenched, but will for ever burn upon them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.7. <hi>Mark</hi> 9.44-48. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.3. &amp; 10.26.29. &amp; 12.25.</p>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:33142:96"/>
               <p>Such things are to be talked of, propoſed to and urged upon men, ſometimes one and ſometimes another of theſe things to convert them to righteouſneſs: as alſo the diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to men of what is the good, acceptable, and perfect will of God as to what he would have them do and practice in their believing on Chriſt, that they may pleaſe him, and have the fellowſhip of his ſpirit and his bleſſing. And ſo what God and Chriſt require of them, and his grace obliges them to do, or deny or to forbear. With the manifold incouragements to obedience, and heartnings thereto againſt all temptations, perſecutions and whatever other diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in propoſing Gods pretious promiſes and gratious readineſs in Chriſt to pardon ſins and accept of weak, if upright, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, and the like, as the Scriptures abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly evidence: to which it would be too long to ſpeak here particularly. Such things are to be held forth by believers in holding forth the word of life in ſhining as lights a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men. Which they are to do alſo,</p>
               <p n="2">2. In their works and converſation: As the Apoſtle alſo implies, when he ſaith; <hi>Do all things without murmuring and diſputing, that ye may be blameleſs and harmleſs</hi> (or fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere) <hi>the Sons of God. Without rebuke in the midst of a crooked and perverſe Nation; among
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:33142:97"/>whom ye ſhine</hi> (or ſhine ye) <hi>as lights.</hi> Name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in ſo walking and demeaning your ſelves. Both theſe ways <hi>Levy</hi> is ſaid to have exerciſed himſelf in, in his turning many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from iniquity, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.6. <hi>The Law of truth</hi> (as the Goſpel is called the <hi>Word of truth,</hi> Epheſ. 1.13.) <hi>was in his mouth: and iniquity was not found in his lips.</hi> There is the firſt thing. And then the ſecond follows, <hi>viz. He walked with me in peace and equity, and turned many from iniquity.</hi> And indeed they that <hi>will not be won by the word, may</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>be won</hi> to the word <hi>by a good Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> as is implyed, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.1. For here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in alſo we may ſhew forth the virtues of Chriſt, and God in him: while we as <hi>Strangers and Pilgrims abſtain from fleſhly luſts, and have our Converſation honest among the Gentiles</hi> (the uncircumciſed in heart) a Converſation that becomes and is anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Goſpel of Chriſt: an holy, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, charitable, courteous, upright and blameleſs Converſation. So as that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <hi>they are apt to ſpeak evil of us, as of evil do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, they may glorifie God</hi> (by occaſion of the good works that they ſhall behold in and from us) <hi>in the day of viſitation,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.9, 11, 12. which our Saviour alſo evidently implies in his exhortation to his Diſciples, aforementioned in <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.16. When he
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:33142:97"/>ſaith, <hi>Let your light ſo ſhine before men, that they may ſee your good works</hi> (walk ſo well and blameleſs before them in your holding forth the word of life, that your works may teſtifie of you, and evidence the force and power of the truth believed, and grace received and declared by you, ſo as men may behold them) <hi>and glorifie your Father which is in Heaven.</hi> For this way alſo we may declare or <hi>ſhew forth his ſalvation:</hi> even ſhew forth in our ſelves, as evidences of it, the ſaving virtue that is in the Goſpel, and Grace believed by us; that the <hi>Goſpel of Chriſt is the power of God to Salvation</hi> (even to ſave men from their ſins in the power and pollution of them; yea and from the clog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging force in ſins guilt in the conſcience <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

For it is the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the love and grace of God to man, that is the ſpring from whence all right frames and works do flow, and by that they are taught, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.11, 12. &amp; 3.4, 5. But truly, while men teach others that Chriſt died but for a few, they know not who, a ſecret number known only to God, and they muſt all by an irreſiſtible power be infallib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and neceſſarily brought in to God; and
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:33142:109"/>for all the reſt, Chriſt having not died, they muſt neceſſarily periſh. What do they but lay ſnares for men to render them careleſs of righteouſneſs, and of the knowledge of God, and to reaſon as ſome do, that if they be of the Elect, they muſt needs be ſaved and cannot miſcarry, let them live at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, as debauehedly as they will or can: and if otherwiſe, what will all their ſeeking af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter God and breaking off from their ſins a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail them? They can be but hypocrites and reprobates, do what they can. If it be ſaid, but the Elect may make themſelves obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to greater puniſhments here by ſinning, and the Reprobates by endeavouring to be good, leſſen their future puniſhments. From their own Principals miſtaking and perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that that is right, they that are skilled in their Doctrine, may retort that to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect all things ſhall work together for good, and their greater unrighteouſneſs ſhall but the more commend the righteouſneſs of God: and the Reprobate ſhall have no leſs puniſhment than God hath decreed to them inevitably. And ſo they that preach to men a neceſſity that thoſe that are once brought truly to believe, muſt abide in the love of God without any ſuch <hi>If,</hi> as Chriſt puts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Diſciples, when he ſaith, <hi>If ye keep my Commandments ye ſhall continue in my love,</hi>
                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:33142:109"/>John 15.10. But they will go higher than our Saviour, and ſay, tuſh: away with theſe <hi>Ifs</hi> here, ye ſhall keep Chriſts Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments and continue in his Love. Or if ye break them (as at other times they will grant, for they read that <hi>David</hi> and St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> did ſo) yet ye muſt be brought in again, ſo as ye cannot poſſibly fail of Salvation, and all thoſe ſins alſo ſhall work together for your good: what do they but ſtrengthen the hand of Sathan, and corruption in caſes of temptation, to prevail with ſuch as have high perſuaſions that they are Elect and true Believers, to preſume to ſin and do unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, as that, that in the iſſue ſhall not hurt them, nay ſhall work to their advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage alſo? And while men make it doubtful in their Preaching whether Chriſt be a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our for them, or hath died for them or not, what do they but hinder them from ſeeing all thoſe ſtrong engagements to believe on him, and ſubmit to him, which that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion, as the Scripture holds it forth, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gages them with? It is true ſuch Preachers and Profeſſors often ſay, If Chriſt died for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>oubly vicious. For 1. If Chriſts dying for men, and mens being perſuaded of it, be a
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:33142:110"/>ground of licentiouſneſs, then men ſhould do ill to be perſuaded that Chriſt died for them, or that they are of the Elect; for by their own reaſoning, Such as are elected, or judg themſelves ſo, may live licentiouſly, and as they liſt, yea are in great danger ſo to do (though they may do it without dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger) ſeeing without doubt Chriſt died for them.

Wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut them off, and caſt them from thee: It is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed, than having two hands or two feet, to be caſt into everlaſting fire. And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out and caſt it from thee, it is better for thee having but one eye to enter into life, rather than having two eyes to be caſt into Hell fire.</hi> And ſurely if things as dear and needful to us as our hands, or feet, or eyes are rather to be parted with by us, than that by offending with them we ſhould looſe our ſouls, much more ſhould we part with any fancy or faſhion, garb or garment, way or practice of vanity, rather than by offending and hindering the ſouls of others, thereby to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr ſuch puniſhment, though all of theſe ways reproved, deprive of happineſs and glory, and expoſe to heavy miſery and judgement, the neglect of wiſdome and righteouſneſs, the being backward or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glecting to do good to others, and to make

No cauſe from theſe things to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, but to hold on their way, as it is ſaid. <hi>The righteous alſo ſhall hold on his way, and he that hath clean hands, ſhall be ſtronger and ſtronger,</hi> Job. 17.9.

That is, <hi>to them that by pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient continuance in well doing ſeek after glory, honor &amp; immortality, eternal life,</hi> Rom. 2.7.

               <p n="1">1.

Indeed He had not Univerſity Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to furniſh him or to know himſelf by; but what He had, was the more immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately or remarkably from God, in and by a diligent Study and practiſe of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and their good inſtructions, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with Godly perſons: to which, from his youth, God by his Grace excited and ſtirred him up, and in which he mightily

And indeed God hath not tyed himſelf, nor us up to the Univerſities for their Learning, for his giving, or our receiving Heavenly wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: But wherever men apply their hearts unto it, and mind its inſtructions in thoſe means of attaining it that he affords them, and walking in what He gives, wait and call upon him for it, He is ready and faithful to give it, as He hath ſaid, <hi>If any of you lack wiſdome, let him</hi> (he ſaith not go to the Univerſities, but) <hi>ask it of God, who giveth to all men liberally</hi> (or ſingly, <gap reason="foreign">

For his Doctrine, becauſe he held the Death of Chriſt to have been for all men, and the Grace in Him to be treaſured up in Him for all men, as what is free for them; and diſſented from thoſe of Mr. <hi>Calvins</hi> mind in his apprehenſions of <hi>Election</hi> and <hi>Reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> but they that cenſured him upon that ſcore, bewray their own ignorance, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief of Gods teſtimony in the Scriptures, and unaquaintedneſs with the manner of its ſpeaking, and are of thoſe that call ſome bodies elſe their Rabbies than Jeſus Chriſt; and follow other Guides rather than his holy Apoſtles, crying up this or that ſuppoſed holy man, more than them and their plain ſayings.

Upon which account many others of the zealous parties more cenſured his practiſe. But I think he followed therein, the way and
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:33142:121"/>practiſe of the holy Prophets and Apoſtles: who though reproving the Errors and Faults in the Jewiſh Church, or thoſe that called themſelves of it, yea and approving and practiſing the Aſſemblings and Speakings to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether of ſuch as feared God, beſides the publick Aſſemblings of the profeſſed Church, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 111.1. &amp; 119.63. <hi>Mark</hi> 1.21. 39 &amp; 2.1, 2. <hi>Luke</hi> 10.38, 39. <hi>Acts</hi> 3.1. &amp; 4.23. &amp; 12.5, 12. yet made not a ſeperation therefrom, till, or otherwiſe than they might be thruſt out by them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.5.

               <p n="2">2. In reſpect of our ſelves, we have great cauſe of ſadneſs, for that God hath deprived us of him &amp; of his farther helpful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and uſefulneſs among us, and that too, in the midſt of his farther endeavours of it. Both as we may reflect upon our unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs for, and want of making due im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:33142:122"/>of ſo good an Inſtrument of good to us, and ſo great a gift of Gods grace and mercy as he was, as what might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke God to take him from us, and to take him away too ſo as he did, both at ſuch a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, where few of his Acquaintance could have the opportunity of viſiting him: and eſpecially in ſuch a manner, as by ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch a feebleneſs to befal him, as took away the benefit of his ſpeaking audibly to us, during the continuance of his ſickneſs (if I may call it a ſickneſs) which though long. He being weak many weeks, yet in all that time he ſpake little ſo as to be well-underſtood a whole Sentence together, only now and then a Sentence. But thoſe about him perceived that he ſpake oftentimes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Chriſt or the Reſurrection, and the hope of the glory to come, and was much in Prayer to God even to his end. Surely God might take him away in ſuch a manner for correction and reproof to the living, as if he ſhould ſignifie therein, that becauſe we made not ſufficient account and uſe of what he had ſo much and oft ſpoke in his life-time, we ſhould have little from him audib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in his dying. Which though it might be imputed partly to his age and ſpentneſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing juſt entred upon his eightieth year, and
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:33142:122"/>having ſpent his natural ſtrength much in his continual writing, meditation and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, and partly to the diſtemper that fell upon his head and nerves and rendred him liſtleſs, drowſy and in a meaſure Lethar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick or Appoplectick, as I conceive. Yet ſeeing God doth often order that they that ſerve him much in their life time, expreſs much of him too in their death in an edifya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble manner to others. And he could, had he pleaſed, have ordered ſuch ſtrength and livelyneſs to him alſo therein. Therefore it is better for us, taking it out of Gods hand as a reproof of our unprofitableneſs, to make that uſe of it for the future, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the mercies God gives us while we have them: as our Saviour admoniſhed the the <hi>Jews,</hi> when he ſaid, <hi>Yet a little while I am with you, and then I go to him that ſent me. Ye ſhall ſeek me and ſhall not find me, and where I am thither ye cannot come,</hi> John 7.33, 34. &amp; 8.21. to the end they might attend to him and make good uſe of him and his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence while yet with them, and where they might find and come to him, and ſo might <hi>walk in the light, while yet the light was with them,</hi> John 12.35, 36. and not as the Poet obſerved to be the common practiſe of men, <hi>Preſentem virtutem odio habere, abſentem quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rere
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:33142:123"/>invidi.</hi> Horat. Slight preſent good, out of envy of it, and then when it is withdrawn ſeek for it when it cannot be had. Surely it's matter of lamentation for the Church and World to be deprived of any uſeful perſons in them. As alſo cauſe of ſadneſs we have, as the taking away ſuch, may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage judgments approaching upon us, as is often found, and as is implyed in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.1, 2. <hi>The righteous man periſheth</hi> (namely from among men) <hi>and no man layeth it to heart. And men of mercy</hi> (or kindneſs) <hi>are taken away, none conſidering that the righteous is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the evil</hi> (either the evil that is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready predominant, as <hi>Lot</hi> from the evil that vext his righteous ſoul, or as we read it, <hi>the evil to come,</hi> as <hi>Lot</hi> alſo was, and <hi>Noah</hi> when taken into the Ark, from the approaching deluge) <hi>He ſhall enter into peace,</hi> &amp;c. In reſpect of him therefore we have cauſe of gladneſs, as our Saviour ſaid to his Diſciples, <hi>John</hi> 14.28. But in reſpect of our ſelves, cauſe to grieve. And God grant that that of our Saviour when the women wept for him when he went to his death, may not be applicable to us, <hi>Weep for you ſelves and for your Children, for behold the days come in which they ſhall ſay, Bleſſed are the barren and the wombs that never bare, and the paps
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:33142:123"/>that never gave ſuck,</hi> &amp;c, Luke 23, 28, 29. Well, what of judgment and correction to us there is in it, it is good for us to bear, <hi>Searching and trying our ways, and turning again to the Lord,</hi> who in divers ſuch ſtrokes and breaches made upon us, hath been ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting us. Bleſſing him that we enjoyed him ſo long, and that he lived to fill up ſo fully the number of his years; in which reſpect there is the leſs of judgment, I conceive, in his being now taken away. And whereas we can now have no farther uſefulneſs of him by any perſonal care of, or ſervice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, let us, bewailing our unprofitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs under what we have had, have the more regard to his Relicks. I mean thoſe good and uſeful Books and Writings (the beſt and trueſt Relicks of the Saints to be made much of by the ſurviving) leſt behind him. In and by which we may yet be min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of the ſum and ſubſtance of what he ſpake to us, and hear him as it were yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing us and reap the labours of his ſpirit for us, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.29. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.15. And let it be alſo our care (as being in this his Death and Burial aptly minded thereof, and provoked thereto) <hi>ſo to number our days as to apply our hearts unto the</hi> heavenly <hi>Wiſdom.</hi> So as we following after the knowledge there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:33142:124"/>and walking therein we may be accepted of God alſo, and be accounted worthy to have our lot and portion among thoſe that be <hi>wiſe,</hi> who <hi>ſhall ſhine as the brightneſs of the Firmanant</hi> in the Kingdom of God; and if it may be that we alſo may be inſtruments of <hi>turning many unto righteouſneſs,</hi> that we may <hi>ſhine</hi> then too <hi>as the Stars for ever and ever.</hi> Amen.</p>
